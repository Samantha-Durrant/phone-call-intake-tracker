# Questions for CRM Integration

Before integrating this component into your PHP CRM, please clarify the following:

1. **JavaScript/CSS Loading**
   - Are there global JS/CSS files already loaded that might conflict (e.g., jQuery, Bootstrap, utility libraries)?
   - Is there a preferred way to load additional JS/CSS (enqueue, asset pipeline, etc.)?

2. **Data Storage and APIs**
   - Is there a backend API or database available for storing/retrieving call data, or should the component remain client-side only?
   - Are there existing endpoints for patient lookup, appointment management, or analytics that should be used?

3. **UI Integration**
   - Should the component be embedded as an iframe, modal, or directly injected into a page?
   - Are there existing UI components (forms, tables, charts) that should be reused or avoided?

4. **Authentication and Permissions**
   - How is user authentication handled? Should the component check for user/session context?
   - Are there permission checks or roles that need to be enforced for intake or analytics access?

5. **Event Handling and Communication**
   - Are there global event buses or message systems in use that the component should hook into?
   - Should the component trigger or listen for custom events within the CRM?

6. **PHP/Backend Integration**
   - Are there PHP classes, functions, or helpers for rendering forms, tables, or handling AJAX requests that should be used?
   - Is there a preferred way to pass data from PHP to JS (e.g., via data attributes, JSON blobs, or AJAX)?

7. **Styling and Theming**
   - Are there global styles/themes that the component should match or avoid overriding?
   - Should the component support dark mode or other theming options?

8. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Is there a centralized error logging or reporting system the component should use?
   - How should user-facing errors be displayed?

9. **Other Platform-Specific Concerns**
   - Are there naming conventions, namespaces, or reserved keywords to avoid?
   - Are there accessibility or localization requirements?
